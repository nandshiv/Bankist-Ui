# Bankist-UI 💻

An interactive front-end project built while following the **JavaScript DOM manipulation** section of [Jonas Schmedtmann's JavaScript course](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-javascript-course/).  
This project is part of my **learning journey**, showcasing core concepts of modern vanilla JavaScript.
